### Features
1. Ease of creating a custom tree of elements with groups. You can also undo and not save all changes.
2. Ability to start the action by default with the left mouse button, and the editor with the right mouse button on the element in the tray. Very useful for scripts!
3. You can also open an element in the program for settings with the middle button.
4. The ability to assign an icon from a resource file (.exe, .dll, .ico) or a file extension icon to a group or element (which is more important). This is especially useful if you're running a script that, after doing something, launches an executable file or document. By default, groups have a regular folder icon, and items have a folder icon (if the command points to a folder), a resource icon (.exe, .dll, .ico), or a file command extension.
5. Ability to run commands and edit under the administrator.
6. If no action is found for the team to edit, the folder will open and the file will be highlighted.
7. Override the default actions in the system to edit and run through Extensions. It also allows you to add file filtering when selecting commands.
8. Ability to assign an opening to a specific folder.
9. Use native or any other language and fluid interface. No installation required.
10. Highlighting a non-existent file (for a .exe file, it is searched in the Path as well as in the registry, similar to how Windows does).
